## Practice

  - Python Environment
  - Code Editor / IDE (personal preferene)
  - Github account and repo (this is where you'll push following programs)
    - Needless to say, no personal/company (empID, project etc.) data on Github.
  - Programs
    - Given a list of names, try printing unique names that are less than 5 character length and doesn't contain the character 'e'.
      - `names = ["john", "jake", "jack", "george", "jenny", "jason"]`
    - Given a string `python`, try printing `cython` using slicing `[start:stop]` and concatenation. `+`
    - Given a dictionary `{"name": "python", "ext": "py", "creator": "guido"}`, print both keys and values.
    - Write a `Developer` class that has a `code` function and a `languages` list.
      - `code` function should accept a `language` param and if the `language` is in the `languages` list it should print `code in <language>`.
      - `resume` function that prints `languages` of the developer.
      - Write a `SrDeveloper` class that inherits `Developer` and adds `review` function. `review` should also be limited to `languages` list.
      - Write a `TechLead` class that inherits from `SrDeveloper` and adds `design` function
