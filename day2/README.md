  - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ PEP 20 - Zen of Python

## Practice

  - Implement a function that accepts any number of orgs and prints them with a double line break
  - What's your favorite from the Zen of Python?
  - Try list comp to get keys that are longer than 4 chars in a dict
  - implement nested list comp in any use case
  - import a func from a module and call it to print some output
  - use python to open another python source file and print the contents
  - Write an iterator yourself
